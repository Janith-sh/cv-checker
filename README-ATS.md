- **Skills Assessment**: Identifies technical and soft skills, suggests missing ones
- **Education Review**: Evaluates educational background relevance
- **Formatting Check**: Ensures ATS-friendly formatting

### 3. Scoring Algorithm
Each section receives a score from 0-100 based on:
- Completeness of information
- Relevance to target job role
- ATS compatibility factors
- Industry best practices

### 4. Results Dashboard
Users receive:
- **Overall Score**: Comprehensive ATS compatibility rating
- **Section Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of each CV section
- **Keyword Analysis**: Found vs. missing keywords for the role
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Prioritized suggestions for improvement
